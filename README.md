The Greenhouse Gas Index database consists of reference datasets and [Python APIs](#python-apis) for accessing them. The data is also made available in json format for use in languages other than Python.

The database is built and maintained by [The Greenhouse Gas Index Organization (GHGI)](https://ghgi.org), a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to reduce GHG emissions by driving individual behaviour change through increased awareness of the climate impact of our everyday choices. Derived from the most current peer-reviewed science, GHGI makes it simple for consumers to understand the climate impact of what they eat.

## [Python APIs](#python-apis)
Documentation to follow.

## Web API
The database is also freely available via a [web API](https://api.ghgi.org) along with [documentation](https://ghgi.org/api/docs).

## Data Structure
Documentation to follow.

## Contributing
We welcome pull requests, especially in the following areas:
* Additions or changes to the master products, origins, and references datasets
* Localizations of the master datasets
* Improvements to the Python APIs
* APIs for other languages

_Detailed instructions about contributing content or localizations to the datasets will follow._

Please note that additions or changes to the reference datasets require reference citations for any materially new information. Citations must reference recent, top-tier, peer-and/or-government-reviewed scientific publications.

If you make use of the database, please make sure to appropriately credit GHGI as the source of your data. We also strongly encourage contributing incremental data directly to this repository (as opposed to forking) in order to build a standard, open, central, canonical resource for GHG food data.

Additionally, if you are using the GHGI DB in a public product, please let us know so we can feature you here.
