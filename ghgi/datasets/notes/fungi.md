# Mushrooms

[Robinson et al][1] found that US mushrooms have a GWG20 impact of **2.95 kg CO2e/kg** from "cradle-to-facility gate".

To that estimate, we have appended the subsequent processsing, transport, packaging, retail, and loss impacts estimated from [Poore & Nemecek][2] as a reasonable (albeit imperfect) proxy; its value is **0.29221 kg CO2e/kg**.

The resultant value for the GHG impact of mushrooms is **3.2422 kg CO2e/kg**, which is reflected in our database.

## Processing, packaging, and retail

Using the following inputs (per [Poore & Nemecek][2]) for CO2e/kg of fresh fruits and vegetables:

| Stage      | GHG Emissions (kg CO2e/kg) |
| ---------- | -------------------------: |
| Processing |                        0.0 |
| Packaging  |                    0.04476 |
| Retail     |                    0.01667 |
| **Total**  |                **0.06143** |

## Transport

Using the following inputs (per [Poore & Nemecek][2]) for refrigerated transportation per 1000km:

| Mode      | GHG Emissions (per tonne km) | Average Distance traveled (fruits and vegetables) (tonne km) | kg CO2e/kg |
| --------- | ---------------------------: | -----------------------------------------------------------: | ---------: |
| Road      |                      0.45617 |                                                          380 |     0.1733 |
| Rail      |                     0.059309 |                                                          122 |     0.0072 |
| Water     |                     0.022952 |                                                         1004 |      0.023 |
| **Total** |                              |                                                              |  **0.203** |

## Loss

The average of the weighted average losses of "Other Vegetables" is **0.02778 kg CO2e/kg**.
