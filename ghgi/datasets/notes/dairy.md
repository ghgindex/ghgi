# Dairy

[Poore & Nemecek][1] calculated the emissions impact of milk, which they standardized to [4% fat and 3.3% protein][1]. They did not provide values for other dairy products except cheese.

This data is extended to derivative dairy products using a co-products allocation based on dry matter as follows:

| Product              | Dry Matter % | Allocation (as a % of whole milk) |
| -------------------- | -----------: | --------------------------------: |
| Butter               |        84.4% |                            644.3% |
| Heavy cream          |        46.0% |                            351.1% |
| Cream cheese         |        45.0% |                            343.5% |
| Crème Fraîche        |        45.0% |                            343.5% |
| Light whipping cream |        40.0% |                            305.3% |
| Ricotta cheese       |        30.0% |                            229.0% |
| Sour Cream           |        29.0% |                            221.4% |
| Condensed milk       |        27.4% |                            208.9% |
| Half and half        |        21.0% |                            160.3% |
| Cottage cheese       |        20.0% |                            152.7% |
| Whole milk           |        13.1% |                            100.0% |
| 2% milk              |        11.1% |                             84.7% |
| 1% milk              |        10.1% |                             77.1% |
| Skim milk            |         9.1% |                             69.5% |
| Buttermilk           |         8.0% |                             61.1% |

> *Example*: this means is that a kg of buttermilk has 61.1% of the emissions impact of whole milk.
