Testing TODOs

    Products
        Data validation:
            √ every entry either has a super or at least one valid Category value
            √ every root (i.e. super-less) entry has values for g, sg
        Functions:
            √ .g function
            √ .sg function
            √ lookup function
            √ mass function
            √ food_values function

            The loss and aggregation functions work

    Origins
        √ every origin entry is keyed to a canonical global name, links to a valid source id, and has a list of 4 data values
        √ the super for every origin exists

    Trigram:
        Functions:
            √ trigrams()
            √ build_indexes()
            √ match()
            √ product_index(), aka_index() load w/o error

    Parser:
        Functions:
            √ amounts() -> various ingredient inputs/output tuples return correctly
            commas, what do we do?
                post-space commas except if numbers on both sides: any text like
                    'x,w' -> 'x, w'
                    '1,w' -> '1, w'
                    'w,1' -> 'w, 1'
                    '1,2' -> '1,2'
            test the quantifier!

            What about names that include stopwords? e.g. "After Eights" or something like that?
                Leave this alone for now, but we might want to flag these to exclude from stopword removal
